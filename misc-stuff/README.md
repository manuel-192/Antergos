## cp.completion
A bash completion file for the 'cp' command.<br>
Handles more options and their values than the official cp completion.<br>
Copy this file into /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/cp.<br>
Note: in file /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion the list of commands using the _longopt function contains
the cp command. It should be removed from the list in order to use this new cp completion.
