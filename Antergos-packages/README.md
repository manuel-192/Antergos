# Collection of pre-built packages (some built from the AUR).

To use the packages below, you need to do these things in your system:
- edit file <b>/etc/pacman.conf</b> and to the end add the following lines:
<pre>
[mgit]
Server = https://github.com/manuel-192/Antergos/raw/master/Antergos-packages
SigLevel = Required
</pre>
- run the following commands:
<pre>
sudo pacman-key --keyserver keys.gnupg.net -r A1F1B5187D25904B
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key A1F1B5187D25904B
</pre>
Now the hard part is done! But still one thing to do: update your repos and packages:
<pre>
sudo pacman -Syyu
</pre>


<b>Disclaimer</b>: <u>use these packages at your own risk!</u> I cannot guarantee the safety of these packages, but I try to build and transfer them here using the best coding and safety practices I know of.

NOTE: Some of these packages may have been built from the AUR repos (e.g. yad and yay). They are here for people who wish to easily download the <i>latest available</i> packages into their systems. I may remove the AUR packages from here at any time, since they are better served at their original locations.
