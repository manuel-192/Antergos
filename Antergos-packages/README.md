# Collection of precompiled AUR and other packages.
The easiest way to install these packages is using the package/program <b>pkgget</b>. Download it first, and then you may install others at will.

<b>Disclaimer</b>: <u>use these packages at your own risk!</u> I cannot guarantee the safety of these packages, but I try to build and transfer them here using the best coding and safety practices I know of.

NOTE: Some of these packages are from the AUR (currently: xed, yad and yay). They are here for people who wish to easily download the latest packages into their systems. I may remove the AUR packages from here at any time, since they are better served at their original locations.
